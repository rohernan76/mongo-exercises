Instructions for running these exercises.

Code commands are given in backticks. Run the commands without the backtick characters.

1. Open the project folder in terminal and execute `npm i`

2. Create a new folder inside the project folder called `data`

3. Run `mongod --dbpath ./data`
	(You might want to run this in a new terminal - just make sure you're inside the project folder.)

4. Run (only once!) `node import.js`
	(If you run this more than once, kill mongo, run `rm -rf ./data` and go back to #2.)

5. Run the server by executing `node exercises.js`.
	(The output for these problems will log to the terminal - there's no webserver here.)

6. Solve the problems in exercises.js - you'll have to edit the imported files.

7. Turn this all in via github!

SPECIAL NOTE FROM ERTY: 

**Don't push mongo data folders to git!** It breaks git and then I have to come fix everything, so don't do it. 

When you start a new repo on your computer put:

node_modules
data

in your .gitignore file for each repo.

Thanks!
